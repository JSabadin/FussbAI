# FussbAI: Table Soccer Reinforcement Learning

FussbAI is a cutting-edge project applying the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm to the strategic game of table soccer (Foosball). This initiative interfaces with the FuzbAISim simulation environment, enabling real-time decision-making and strategy development for virtual table soccer gameplay.

## Simulation Environment

This project utilizes the FuzbAISim simulation environment for its operations. For more details on this simulation, visit [FE-LAK/FuzbAISim](https://github.com/FE-LAK/FuzbAISim).

## Features

- Real-Time Decision Making: Makes use of live camera data from the game server to inform strategic decisions.
- SAC Algorithm Implementation: Employs the advanced Soft Actor-Critic algorithm for managing continuous action spaces.
- RESTful API Integration: Communicates with the game simulation server via REST API, facilitating a dynamic exchange of actions and game states.
